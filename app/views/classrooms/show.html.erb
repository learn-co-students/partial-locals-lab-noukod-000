Classroom Info
<%= render 'classroom' %>

We now want to call out the oldest student in the class:
<%= render partial: 'students/student', locals: { student: @classroom.oldest_student } %>

<h2>All students</h2>
<ul>
  <% @classroom.students.each do |student| %>
  <li><%= render partial: 'students/student', locals: { student: student } %></li>
  <% end %>
</ul>
